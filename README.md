# Granulation-Noise
This Python script calculates the convective blueshift and radial velocity
dispersion of stars based on their stellar parameters such as temperature
mass, radius, and surface gravity. The script also estimates errors in these
calculations. The code is designed to be flexible for different stars,
allowing users to input stellar parameters and obtain corresponding convective
blueshift and radial velocity dispersion values. Finally, it showcases the
application of these calculations for various stars, demonstrating their
utility in astrophysical research.
